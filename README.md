# IGBM
Jupyter Notebooks to practice and learn more about data science on health for MD students.

Currently working with Clinical Departments on Hospital Universitario "Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez" @Monterrey, Nuevo Leon.

Our main goal is to create resources suitable for the clinical field by developing essential skills and scalate them into machine learning 
models applied on medicine such as diagnostic or predictive tools.

Feel free to clone and use any resource here provided and let us know if you have any comment.

Thank you.
